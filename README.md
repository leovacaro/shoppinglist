# shoppinglist
Web application based on Java and Spring Boot for managing shopping lists.

The goal of this project is to define a use case for applying the concepts that I have been learning in the Computer Programming course from Sheridan College: software development, design patterns, database management, security, code quality, user experience.

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/leovacaro/shoppinglist/wiki) for detailed project specifications.

## Features
* Users can self register in the application.
* Users can create multiple shopping lists.
* Users can specify product items, prices, and associated quantities.

## Technologies
* Java.
* Spring Boot framework.
* Spring MVC, Spring Security, Spring Data JDBC.
* Thymeleaf for creating HTML templates.
* Relational database persistence (MySQL).

## Design Patterns
* Model View Controller (MVC).
* Data Access Object (DAO).
* Service Layer.
* Inversion of Control (IOC).

## Development Environment
The instructions in this section are based on the Windows system.
However, all of the components and technologies work on other platforms such as Linux.

* Install MySQL.
* Install Eclipse.
* Clone this repositorie using Git.
* Create a workspace in Eclipse.
* Import this project into the Eclipse workspace.

## Next Steps
* Adopt the Java Persistence API (JPA) for simplifying relational database access through Java objects.
* Host this Web application into the Cloud.
